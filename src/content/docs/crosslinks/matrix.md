# WA Animal Welfare Transparency Archive

> *A public memory — against forgetting.*  
> *A witness to systems that perform oversight while practising erasure.*

## What This Is
This site is a **public evidence archive**.  
It records not only what government said — but what it refused to document.  

Each FOI request produces one of four symbols:  
`✓ Found` · `~ In process` · `∅ None` · `✖ Hidden`  
Together they map **how oversight collapses in plain sight**.

## 🕊️ The Story of Citizen A

> *What happens when an ordinary person tries to see?*

**Citizen A is an ordinary person.**  
She has no title, no connections—only the memory of caring for a few animals and knowing they could feel pain.  
So she asked a simple question: *How are farmed animals living now?*

She searched through government websites and found only gentle sentences:

> “We are deeply committed to animal welfare.”

But every link opened onto emptiness—no inspection reports, no penalty records,  
not even a document describing how inspections were done.

So she lodged a Freedom of Information (FOI) request—  
the law that promises citizens the “right to know.”

The first reply came quickly:

> “No such documents exist.”

Citizen A was confused.  
None at all?  
Then how is the government supervising anything?

She sent an internal review request. Weeks later, a new letter arrived:

> “Some records exist, but they cannot be released.”

So “nothing” became “something, but you can’t see it.”

She asked again:  
Are there rules for inspections?  
A standard operating procedure?  
Any internal risk assessments?

The answer was always the same:

> “No documents exist.”

It turned out there were not only no results—there was no process.

So she filed a third FOI.  
If all this was missing, had the Agriculture Department reported the issue to the Minister?  
To Parliament?

Weeks later, the answer came:

> “No documents exist.”

Not a single risk assessment.  
No briefing note.  
No memo.  

Even silence had no record.

While sending that request, she also asked the Office of the Information Commissioner (OIC) to review the Department’s handling.  
But OIC had troubles of its own:

> “Our case backlog is significant. There is no estimated timeframe.”

She then turned to the Ombudsman, asking them to examine the OIC.  
A courteous letter came back:

> “By law, we cannot investigate the OIC.”  
> And because the OIC was still reviewing the Department, the Ombudsman could not investigate the Department either.

It was like hearing a door quietly lock.

So she looked deeper.  
She found that the OIC, the Ombudsman, Parliament committees, and the Auditor General are all **exempt from the FOI Act**.

The very bodies meant to oversee the system  
are themselves outside public scrutiny.

She tried one more thing:  
Filed an FOI with the OIC itself, asking for internal policies—  
How are cases assigned? What are their timelines? How many are delayed?

Weeks passed.  
Then a short letter arrived:

> “This office is listed in Schedule 2 of the Freedom of Information Act.  
> The Act does not apply to us.”

Even her filing fee was returned.

**Citizen A smiled.**  
She had finally seen the full picture:
- The Agriculture Department was waiting on the OIC.  
- The OIC could not be supervised.  
- The Ombudsman could not investigate the OIC.  
- Parliament could only accept and archive complaints.

All the doors were still there—  
yet behind each one waited another that read, “Temporarily unavailable.”

She began to understand:  
inside this grand palace of procedure, everyone had a part to play—  
one was in charge of saying *“nothing,”*  
one of saying *“waiting,”*  
one of saying *“no authority,”*  
and one of filing everything away.

**Together, they formed a perfect circle,  
whose center was no one responsible.**

Citizen A felt no anger, and she did not cry.  
She simply arranged all the letters and refusals,  
and placed them on a small website.  
No accusations, no conspiracy theories—just documents and dates.

She called it **Unseen Beings**.

> *The site is a mirror,*  
> *letting people see for themselves:*  
> *when an ordinary citizen seeks the truth,*  
> *the democratic system can, politely and procedurally,*  
> *show her nothing at all.*

“This isn’t the end of the story,” she says.  
“It’s only the edge of the map.”

Someday, perhaps, citizens B, C, and D will walk this same path,  
see the map she left behind,  
and understand how the illusion works.

## Findings So Far
**FOI1 → Result Vacuum**  
Inspection and enforcement outcomes could not be produced; the internal review later contradicted the original denial.

**FOI2 → Process Vacuum**  
No oversight records, no risk assessments, no compliance frameworks.  
IR2 upheld the emptiness; ER2 filed.

**FOI3 → Accountability Vacuum**  
No ministerial briefings, no escalation to OAG/Ombudsman, no internal risk memos since 2022.  
IR3 confirmed total silence; ER3 filed.

**FOI4 → System Structure Vacuum**  
No legal-authority logs, no record‑keeping frameworks, no financial delegations for inspectorate functions.

**FOI5 → Ministerial Oversight Vacuum**  
Testing whether the Minister holds AWAC reports, DI governance briefings, or any statutory oversight records.

**Ombudsman (Sept 2025)**  
Formally refused jurisdiction over OIC delays, completing the oversight deadlock.

**Outcome:**  
Oversight bodies now verify their own inertia:  
OIC = time black hole → Ombudsman = “no jurisdiction” → Parliament = symbolic theatre.  
**The oversight chain has collapsed by design.**

how promises repeated, language recycled, and accountability dissolved —

## Why It Matters

Since 2023, unauthorised filming or entry into animal farming facilities has been criminalised in WA.  
This leaves **Designated Inspectors (DIs)** as the **sole legal witnesses** inside spaces where animals often endure **extreme confinement, mutilation, and psychological trauma**.

What vanishes in this silence is not just institutional data, but the **reality of lives endured in cages, crates, and industrial sheds**.  
**Animals live, suffer, and die in silence. This site ensures that silence is not total.**

## Transparency Timeline (Key Points)

| Year | Event | Reality |
|------|-------|----------|
| 2002 | Animal Welfare Act | “Modern law” with no enforcement framework |
| 2020 | Independent Review | 52 recommendations supported, none enacted |
| 2023 | Trespass & DI Act | DIs created, transparency used to justify repression |
| 2025 | FOI Cycles | Void proven across law, policy, and oversight |

## Structural Meaning
What began as bureaucracy has revealed itself as **architecture** —  
a deliberately hollow system built to display responsibility while erasing evidence.  
This archive exists to preserve that design in public record.
