# SBS Harness Case – Summary

> _Between 2022 and 2025, **Linden** and **Asoka** were restrained on a Western Australian public school bus under the authority of the Public Transport Authority’s School Bus Services (SBS).  
> No clinical assessment. No quarterly review. No fade-out plan.  
> Every oversight body stayed silent._

## 1. What Happened

In mid-2022, SBS approved the use of a **mechanical restraint (harness)** for two autistic, non-speaking brothers — Linden and Asoka — so they could travel safely on a regional school bus route.  
The approval was signed internally by SBS staff **without any occupational therapist, behaviour specialist, or clinical evaluation**.

From 2022 to 2025, the harness remained in constant use.  
**No review occurred**, despite SBS’s own Student Transport Assistance Policy (STAP 2020 §6.5) requiring control devices to be “reviewed at least every three months”.

When their parents repeatedly requested a professional review and a fade-out plan in early 2025, SBS responded that **“families are responsible for initiating professional assessment.”**

## 2. The Pattern of Inaction

| Year | Event | What it shows |
|------|--------|---------------|
| **2022 Feb–Aug** | Harness authorised and installed by SBS (Contract Officer Melissa Roe). | Internal approval, no professional oversight. |
| **2022 – 2025** | Harness used daily, never re-assessed. | Breach of STAP §6.5 quarterly review duty. |
| **2024 Jul** | PTA silently updates STAP → adds §7.5 “qualified prescriber required”. | Implicit admission of previous policy gap. |
| **2025 Feb–Aug** | Parents request review + fade-out plan. SBS replies: “Families responsible.” | Delegation of duty → burden shifted to family. |
| **2025 Oct 20** | PTA “Final Response” letter. Acknowledges no review occurred. Refuses investigation. | Administrative maladministration confirmed. |

## 3. Oversight Chain – and How It Broke

### Ombudsman WA
- Complaint C/53598 lodged Aug 2025 → **not investigated.**  
- Office forwarded it to PTA for self-response, contrary to §17 of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1971.  
- A new case number (C/54176) was later created — effectively **“washing the case.”**

### Equal Opportunity Commission WA
- Accepted as an “impairment discrimination” complaint under the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA).  
- Confirmed it **cannot investigate federal disability standards or restrictive practice frameworks.**  
- Case remains open but limited to state jurisdiction.

### Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC)
- Complaint lodged under the **Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth).**  
- Refused under **section 13(4)** because a state complaint (EOC WA) was already in progress.  
- When asked to review the decision, the Commission confirmed the bar remains — creating a **jurisdictional dead loop.**

## 4. Legal and Policy Context

| Framework | Required by Law | What Actually Happened |
|------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **STAP 2020 §6.5** | Control devices must be reviewed every 3 months. | No review in 3 years. |
| **STAP 2024 §7.5** | Must be prescribed by a qualified professional with a review schedule. | Policy introduced after 3 years of non-compliance. |
| **Disability Services Act 1993 (WA)** | State agencies must ensure qualified assessment and safe services. | Duty delegated to parents. |
| **Disability Standards for Education 2005 (Cth)** | Reasonable adjustments and least restrictive support. | No therapist input, no adjustment plan. |
| **National Framework for Reducing Restrictive Practices (2014)** | Any mechanical restraint must be professionally supervised and time-limited. | Ignored. |

## 5. Where Things Stand Now

- **PTA/SBS:** Acknowledged the policy breach but refused to remedy it.  
- **Ombudsman WA:** No investigation initiated.  
- **EOC WA:** Complaint accepted under state law only; no federal review.  
- **AHRC:** Closed under s13(4) — jurisdiction bar remains.  
- **Family:** Left without clinical support or fade-out plan; Linden still travels restrained each day.

## 6. What This Case Reveals

> **Administrative Maladministration → Regulatory Vacuum → Disability Burden Shift → Jurisdictional Dead Loop**

Each layer of oversight functions formally, yet in practice cancels the one beneath it.  
A family followed every rule. Every rule failed them.
