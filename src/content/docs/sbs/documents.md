complaint about PTA’s failure to review the harness.

> or restrictive-practices frameworks.

> offline and are not listed here.

## 4. Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC)

These materials show the attempt to bring the case under the Disability

> The complaint was lodged under the DDA with authority to act on behalf
> of non-verbal children.

> related complaint was already on foot at the state level (EOC WA),
> and later confirmed that this bar would remain in place.
